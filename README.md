# hello-world
My First Repository

Hi there! I've just started learning web-developmet and it was recommended that I initiate a github account. Just getting to know the program/website and hope to learn more!

Wow, I've been learning a lot and I've been creating websites, but I still don't have anything on Github! I think I need to start putting some of my projects here for potential employers! Maybe I'll actually get a job someday! HaHa!!

I finally got something up! Checkout my <a href="https://superjoefly.github.io">Github Page</a> to see what I'm about! There are also a few links to some of my projects that are located elsewhere. Thanks :-)
